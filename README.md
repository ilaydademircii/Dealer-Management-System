# Dealer Management System Using Java Swing and MySQL

## About the Project

This project is a **Dealer Management System** developed using **Java Swing** for the user interface and **MySQL** as the backend database.
It supports adding second-hand, new, and trade-in vehicles, managing vehicle sales, recording payments, tracking outstanding balances, and viewing customer payment histories.

The application is designed using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to clearly separate the user interface, business logic, and data handling layers.
Additionally, the **Command Design Pattern** is implemented to encapsulate business actions (such as save, delete, and update) into reusable command classes, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

## Features

* **Add Vehicles:**

  * Second-hand vehicles
  * New vehicles
  * Trade-in vehicles
* **Vehicle Sales:** Record and manage sales transactions
* **Receive Payments:** Process and record customer payments
* **Remaining Balances:** Monitor outstanding payments
* **Customer Payment History:** View detailed payment records

## Technologies

* Java (Swing for GUI)
* MySQL (Relational Database)
* JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
* **MVC Architecture**
* **Command Design Pattern**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ilaydademircii/Dealer-Management-System-Using-Java-Swing-MySQL.git
   ```
2. Import the project into your Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Set up a MySQL database and run the provided SQL scripts (if available) to create the necessary tables.
4. Configure the database connection settings (URL, username, password) in the projectâ€™s configuration file or in the source code.
5. Build and run the application.

## Usage

* Use the graphical interface to:

  * Add vehicles by category (second-hand, new, or trade-in)
  * Record and manage sales transactions
  * Receive customer payments and track balances
  * View individual customer payment histories and monitor overall outstanding payments

## Architecture

This project follows a clean **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design:

* **Model:** Handles data access and business logic
* **View:** Implements the GUI using Java Swing
* **Controller:** Acts as the intermediary between the view and the model

In addition, the **Command Design Pattern** is used to encapsulate operations (e.g., AddVehicleCommand, DeleteCustomerCommand) as objects.
This improves reusability, flexibility, and makes it easier to implement features like undo/redo or logging.
